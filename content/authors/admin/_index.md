Hey there! I'm Wei Ouyang, an assistant prof over at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, where I run the [AICell Lab](https://aicell.io). We're pretty lucky to have funding from the [Data-Driven Life Science fellow program](https://www.scilifelab.se/research/?filter=all#DDlsfellows), and we're all about diving into AI systems that can make a real impact in cell and molecular biology.

My journey started with a PhD in computational image analysis from Institut Pasteur in Paris. That's where I got hooked on deep learning and its applications in super-resolution microscopy. Fun fact: I came up with this cool method called ANNA-PALM that boosts the speed of super-resolution localization microscopy by, like, 100 times!

After my PhD, I hung out for four years with [Emma Lundberg](https://biox.stanford.edu/people/emma-lundberg) and her research crew as a postdoc. That experience really got me thinking about how to make AI tools more accessible. So, I came up with [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io), an open-source platform that simplifies the whole process of building and using deep learning tools.

I'm super passionate about making science more open and accessible, so I co-founded the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io) project under the [the AI4Life consortium](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/) (supported by the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme). It's a hub where we share AI models specifically designed for bioimage analysis.

Mainly, I'm into AI-augmented microscopy and data-driven models that can capture the complexities of an entire cell. So, yeah, that's me in a nutshell!

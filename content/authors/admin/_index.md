Wei OUYANG is an assistant professor in the department of applied physics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm, Sweden). He is currently leading a research group, the [AICell Lab](https://aicell.io), which is funded by the [Data-Driven Life Science fellow program](https://www.scilifelab.se/research/?filter=all#DDlsfellows). The group focuses on building AI systems for cell and molecular biology.

Dr. Ouyang obtained his PhD in computational image analysis at Institut Pasteur, Paris where he mainly focuses on applying deep learning for super-resolution microscopy. During this period, he developed a deep learning method called ANNA-PALM which massively accelerates super-resolution localization microscopy by 100x. He spent 4 years at [Emma Lundberg](https://biox.stanford.edu/people/emma-lundberg)'s group as a postdoctoral researcher. To address the challenges in the dissemination of AI tools, he developed an open-source computational platform, [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io), which makes deep learning tools easier to build and more accessible to the user. He is actively involved in consortiums and community activities for promoting more open, scalable, accessible and reproducible scientific tools. Among them, he is leading the development of the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io) for sharing AI models in bioimage analysis.

Dr. Ouyang is mainly interested in AI augmented microscopy imaging and data-driven whole-cell modeling.
